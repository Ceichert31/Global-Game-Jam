## Description

Stage Crew is a single-player arcade-strategy game where you manage the chaos of opening night at a live theater. Keep runaway props in place and operate the lights as actors move across the stage. Your objective is to keep the audience satisfied or they'll walk out before the final curtain. The show must go on!
